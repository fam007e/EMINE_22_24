Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the kinetics produced by reactivity oscillations in a subcritical nuclear multiplication system. Given the present interest in source-injected, subcritical systems, a full understanding of the system response to periodic reactivity oscillations is critical. As demonstrated by Ravetto (1997) and Dulla et al. (2006), reactivity oscillations in a multiplying system can destabilize its response and result in exponentially-diverging power transients.

Molten salt reactors are an important example of where such destabilizing mechanisms can occur, as reactivity oscillations can be observed when lumps of precipitated fissile material spontaneously form inside the system. As these microscopic structures are immersed in the fluid fuel, the fluid flow transports them through the core and primary circuits, causing periodic reactivity changes. Furthermore, the examination of the power transient created in a nuclear reactor by vibrating control rods, which constitutes another fascinating subject in nuclear reactor physics, may benefit from the understanding of the kinetics induced in a multiplication system by reactivity oscillations.
