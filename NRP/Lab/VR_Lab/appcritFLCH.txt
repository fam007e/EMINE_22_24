Can you make a flow chart from this following procedures for approaching to criticality experiment for presentation:                                                                                             Step 1: Take initial value of rod position, x_0 and initial count rate CR_0 at x_0,CR_0(x_0). 
Step 2: Measure count rate, CR_i at x_i,CR_i(x_i), and calculate CR_0(x_0)/CR_i(x_i)
Step 3: Use the points in the graph (x_i-1 , CR_0(x_0)/CR_i(x_i-1)) and (x_i , CR_0(x_0)/CR_i(x_i)) to make a straight line.
Step 4: Find where the line intercepts the x-axis, i.e. y = 0 which can be found from general equation for straight line (x-x_1)/(x_1-x_2)=(y-y_1)/(y_1-y_2). The x_int = -y_1(x_1-x_2)/(y_1-y_2) + x_1
Step 5: Therefore to get a conservative estimate of next rod position movement  we use the rod position value obtained from Monte-Carlo simulation on VR-1 reactor geometry, x_MC and we guess the new rod position x_i+1 = x_i + (1/3)[min(x_int,x_MC) - x_i]
Step 6: Move CR to x_i+1 and now x_i = x_i+1
