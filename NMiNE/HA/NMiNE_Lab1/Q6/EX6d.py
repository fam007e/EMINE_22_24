#d) Here is a Python implementation of Newton's method for solving a general non-linear equation:
def newton(f, df, x0, epsilon=1e-6, max_iter=50):
    """
    Solve f(x)=0 using Newton's method.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    f : function
        Function to solve.
    df : function
        Derivative of f.
    x0 : float
        Initial guess for the solution.
    epsilon : float, optional
        Tolerance for the solution. The default is 1e-6.
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations to perform. The default is 50.
    
    Returns
    -------
    x : float
        Approximate solution to f(x)=0.
    """
    x = x0
    for i in range(max_iter):
        fx = f(x)
        if abs(fx) < epsilon:
            return x
        dfx = df(x)
        if dfx == 0:
            raise ValueError("Derivative is zero. Cannot continue.")
        x = x - fx/dfx
    raise ValueError("Solution did not converge.")

#To use this solver to find the second solution starting with y0 = -2, you would need to provide the function f and its derivative df as inputs to the newton function. For example:
def f(x):
    # Return the function f(x)
    return x**2 - 2

def df(x):
    # Return the derivative of f(x)
    return 2*x

y0 = -2
y = newton(f, df, y0)
print(f"Solution for the equation with y0=-2 : {y}")

'''
Explanationfor step 4
This should output the approximate solution for the equation f(x)=0 starting from the initial guess y0 = -2.
Note that the actual solution may not be exactly equal to y due to the approximate nature of numerical methods like Newton's method.
