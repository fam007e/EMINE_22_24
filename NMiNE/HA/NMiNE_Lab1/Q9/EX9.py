Here is the complete Python code that includes the function solve_lambert_equation,
which is used to solve the Lambert equation for a given value of x and a given branch (specified by the parameter branch), 
and calls the function to solve the equation for a range of x values:
'''

        y_guess = y_prev - (2 * f(y_prev) * f_prime(y_prev)) / (2 *   f_prime(y_prev)**2 - f(y_prev) * f_prime_prime(y_prev))
        num_iterations += 1

    # Calculate the absolute error between the exact value of y and the computed solution using Halley's method

# Calculate the values of the function for each branch
y_values_w0 = [solve_lambert_equation(x, 0) for x in x_values_w0]
y_values_w_1 = [solve_lambert_equation(x, -1) for x in x_values_w_1]

# Plot the two branches on the same graph
plt.plot(x_values_w0, y_values_w0, 'b')
plt.plot(x_values_w_1, y_values_w_1, 'r')

# Add a black marker at the point (x = -1/e, y = -1)

'''
This code defines a function called solve_lambert_equation that takes two arguments: x and branch. 
It solves the Lambert equation ye^y = x for y using either Newton's method or Halley's method, 
depending on which method gives a solution with lower error.

The function then returns the solution for the given value of x and the given branch (specified by the branch parameter). 
The function first defines the function f(y) that represents the Lambert equation, as well as its derivative f_prime(y) and second derivative f_prime_prime(y) for use in Halley's method.

The function then uses Newton's method and Halley's method to solve the equation for y, 
and calculates the absolute error for each method. 
It returns the solution with the lower error.

The code then defines two arrays of values for x: x_values_w0 and x_values_w_1, 
which represent the domain for each branch of the Lambert equation. 
It calculates the values of the function for each branch using a list comprehension and the solve_lambert_equation function.

The code then plots the two branches on the same graph using the plot function from matplotlib, 
with the values in x_values_w0 and y_values_w0 plotted in blue and the values in x_values_w_1 and y_values_w_1 plotted in red. 
It also adds a black marker at the point (x = -1/e, y = -1) using the plot function. Finally, it shows the plot using the show function.
