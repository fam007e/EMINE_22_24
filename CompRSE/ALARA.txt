ALARA
As defined in Title 10, Section 20.1003, of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR 20.1003), ALARA is an acronym for "as low as (is) reasonably achievable," which means making every reasonable effort to maintain exposures to ionizing radiation as far below the dose limits as practical, consistent with the purpose for which the licensed activity is undertaken, taking into account the state of technology, the economics of improvements about the state of technology, the economics of improvements concerning benefits to the public health and safety, and other societal and socioeconomic considerations, and about the utilization of nuclear energy and licensed materials in the public interest.
