sim. fuel cycles

Assemblies depleted--nuclide composition changed over a no. of timesteps--excess of reactivity changed at each timesteps

Power dist, excess of reactivity change over a fuel cycle 

estimate ---how long the fuel cycle may last--how long excess of reactivity run the reactor 

Units in SERPENT--- Power in W and Burnup in days

-checkvolumes <N> (est. the material vol. by sampling N random points)---compare this volume with the input value to see if there's been a mistake
