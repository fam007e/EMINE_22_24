melting temperature for UO2 is 2800°C for an unirradiated element
MOX is 2737°C for an unirradiated element                          
These values decrease with burn-up.
By precluding fuel melting, the fuel geometry is preserved, and possible adverse effects of molten fuel on the cladding are eliminated.
During modes of operation associated with PCC1 and PCC2 events, there is at least a 95% probability that the peak W/cm fuel rods will not exceed the fuel melting temperature at the 95% confidence level.
The requirement is that there is at least a 95% probability at a 95% confidence level that departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) will not occur on the limiting fuel rods during normal operation and operational transients and in any transient conditions arising from faults of moderate frequency (PCC1 and PCC2 events).
