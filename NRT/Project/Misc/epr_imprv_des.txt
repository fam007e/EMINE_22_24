The evaluation of enhancements to the EPR design regarding gaseous radioactive releases, except tritium and carbon-14, is conducted through a thorough analysis of the source of gaseous releases from operational reactors for each isotope family. Quantification of the impact of the EPR design follows this. The EPR has several design features, including a gaseous waste treatment system derived from the Konvoi design that differs from the 1300 MWe units. This system reduces gaseous volumes released during normal operation. It includes a common gaseous waste treatment system, continuous nitrogen sweeping of tank blankets, and recombination of hydrogen, gas recycling, and radioactive decay in active carbon beds. Additionally, the EPR has a metallic liner on the inner wall of the reactor building to limit the infiltration of radioactive gases into the annulus. The reactor building does not release any gas during the cycle, except for purging system operation for in-service reactor building maintenance, and ventilation systems can switch to an iodine trap. The potential improvements from the new gaseous waste treatment system design vary based on the primary system's condition. Still, they are estimated to be around 20% for inert gases and iodine isotopes and 15% for other gaseous releases on average.
