When we examined the flow characteristics for each power level, we noticed that for 150%, 100%, and 50% power,
there was single phase steam at the very low flow rate percentages. Then in the medium flow rate percentages,
we noticed that there was 2 phase flow. The transition from single phase steam to 2 phase flow was marked by a
distinct upward bump where the curve shifts from more steep to less steep ascent. In the high flow rate percentages,
we noticed that there was single phase water. The transition from 2 phase flow to single phase water was also marked
by a distinct bump, but this time downward. It occurred where the curve shifted from less steep to more steep ascent.

However, the for 0% power, there were no single phase steam or 2 phase flow. Since there was no power being produced,
there was no heat energy to heat the water up. Therefore, the flow characteristics for 0% power was a continuous curve
representing single phase water at all flow percentages.

An interesting thing we noted was that, at the very low flow percentages, the total pressure was higher for 0% power than
all the other power percentages. This occurred because there was single phase water at those low flow percentages for 0% power
but single phase steam for the other power percentages. So, the gravity pressure drop and the friction pressure drop at 0%
power was higher than those at higher power percentages. That is why the total pressure drop was higher for 0% power at the
lowest flow percentages.
